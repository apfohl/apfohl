### Hi there, I'm Andreas! ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Andreas Pfohl and I'm a full-stack software developer with 7+ years of experience from Magdeburg in Germany. Tho I started coding on quite some projects during my studies I did a lot of passion projects for way longer back starting in high school. Most of my experience comes from working at the [bridgefield GmbH](https://bridgefield.de/), where I worked on several fields like automotive industry, heavy machinery industry, security asset management and many more. I developed software components from all parts of the stack: server backends, web frontends, native clients, databases, software libraries, just to name the obvious candidates.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on open sourcing frequently used components for a day to day use.
- ðŸ“– I'm currently reading *Functional Programming in C#* by **Enrico Buonanno**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to be a father ðŸ§¸.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting open source projects.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/his
